=====================
.7
	Release for Mono 1.2+
		- Added sql scripts to modify owner of table, functions,
		  sequences.
		- Consolidated *.sql scripts into single init.sh script
		  which can be executed as root, but create
		  database objects with the proper owners and permissions.
		- Changed default portal name to ibuymono, and default
		  database username and password to test to match other
		  asp.net starter kits released for mono.

=====================
.6
	Release for Mono 1.0.2 / 1.1.1 
		- Removed hack from DesktopModules\XmlModule.ascx 
                  that was added in .5 because the asp:xml control
                  now loads xml documents using the correct path.

=====================
.5
	Release for Mono 1.0 
		- Corrected bug in Configuration.cs which caused all i
		  GetModuleSettings calls to return no records.  This 
		  prevented controls like the XmlModule and ImageModule 
		  from attempting to load.
		- Patched a hack into DesktopModules\XmlModule.ascx to 
		  allow control to load properly.  The mono bug this hides 
		  is one in which an MS.NET asp:xml control will only load 
		  an xml document from the relative path within the web app, 
		  whereas Mono will only load an xml document from an 
		  absolute system path.
		- Patched Admin\Logoff.aspx so that logoff now actually 
		  logs the user out.  This addresses a Mono / mod_mono 
		  bug where accessing cookies after executing 
		  FormsAuthentication.SignOut() prevented the authentication 
		  cookie from actually being removed. 
		- Replaced usage of NpgsqlDataReader and the Npgsql 
		  namespace with IDataReader and the System.Data namespace 
		  within the presentation layer (all .aspx and .ascx files) 
		  in order to decouple it from the data access layer.  This 
		  means that in order to reinstate SQL Server database 
		  support with the Portal, the Components directory is now 
		  directly replaceable the original IBuySpy Components 
		  directory. In the case of the SDK version, databases can 
		  be changed by swapping out the portal.dll and adding the 
		  Sql Server ConnectionString to the appSettings section in 
		  Web.config.  This also clears the way for additional 
		  database support through new data access layers for 
		  databases (such as Firebird).
		- Special thanks to Joe Audette for bringing some of the 
		  above issues to my attention, and otherwise pointing me 
		  in the right direction coming up with the other solutions.

=====================
.4
	Release for Mono Beta 1
		- Release for both inline style (SDK) and
                  code-behind style (VS) projects
		- Makefile included to build VS version,
		  special thanks to Francisco "Paco" Martinez, 
		  Todd Berman, et al, for prj2make# at 
		  http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?prj2make-sharp
		- Significant changes to INSTALL regarding
		  installing on Mono Beta 1 and mod_mono .8
		- Changed configuration of pg_hba.conf to use
		  password instead of trust method of authentication
