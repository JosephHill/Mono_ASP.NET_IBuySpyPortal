Assumptions:
You have installed Mono Beta 1 (0.91) (probably from Red Carpet or rpm)
Specific packages include (plus dependencies):
	mono-core
        mono-web-forms
	mono-data-postgresql
	mono-remoting
	xsp

You have installed mod_mono .8 (There is not currently an rpm for this.  Running make install is easy, though.  Download and instructions are currently at http://go-mono.org/archive/xsp-0.10.html)

Have postgres installed 

Need to have plpgsql registered in template1; otherwise, use included install script (plpgsql.sql) to install into template1 or into the portal db after completing the INSTALL steps.

1) As root, install the database "ibuymono":

		sudo ./init.sh

2) Ensure that the postgres application user (test above) can connect through tcpip

	a) Enable tcpip in postgresql.conf *  (This is probably the first setting in the file, just change it from false to true and uncomment it)

		tcpip_socket = true

	b) In pg_hba.conf *, add this line for the least priveleged settings for the app to connect (where monoportal is the user created in the step above)

		host    portal    monoportal    127.0.0.1    255.255.255.255    password

* In Red Hat 9 / Fedora Core 1, these files are located in /var/lib/pgsql/data/

3)  Restart postgres

4)  Configure apache in httpd.conf * (If you've ran anything in mod_mono, you've probably done most of this...)

	a)  Add these lines (setting mono to handle requests to your application):

MonoApplications "/portal:/your/application/root"
<Directory /your/application/root>
        SetHandler mono
</Directory>

	b)  Add this line to reference the application root

		Alias /portal "/your/application/root"

	c)  Ensure that Default.aspx is in the DirectoryIndex 

		DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var Default.aspx

* In Red Hat 9 / Fedora Core 1, this file is located in /etc/httpd/conf/

5)  Restart Apache

7)  Build the Components
	a) PortalCSVS (Visual Studio / Code-Behind version):
	   in /your/application/root/
		make

	b) PortalCS (SDK / Inline code version): 
           in /your/application/root/Components/
		mcs /t:library /r:Npgsql.dll /r:System /r:System.Data /r:System.Web /out:../bin/portal.dll *.cs

8) Start and enjoy (=test) your portal.  It may be necessary to restart mono (mod_mono server) after doing the build

	a) killall mono 

------------------------------------------------


Enjoying your portal -  First things first:  When you load the portal, you probably want to login as guest with password guest and create a new administrator user.  Then, you can remove the administrative priveleges from the guest account.  (Or, better yet, remove the guest account altogether)


------------------------------------------------

Todo: 

	- A portal module (or sql script, even) to easily create new, empty portals would be nice
	- Document streaming from the DB does not yet work
